PROBLEM 1:
Take two DNA strings as input.

Start a counter at 0 to count differences.

Loop through each letter in the first DNA string and compare it to the same-position letter in the second string, at tHe same time.

Every time the letters are not the same, add 1 to the counter.

After the loop, return the counter.
